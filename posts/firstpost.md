# I don‚Äôt have to understand what a static site is to create an 11ty blog
The idea is to document my learning throughout the days and weeks. For example I am doing the easiest algorithms on codewars and I learn a ton. For example I learnt the `uniq` method, `sorted()`, `set()`, `[ $a -lt $b ]` is a conditional operation where the left hand side is less than the right hand side. It doesn‚Äôt matter where I start learning, I found this learning style, like in jiu jitsu, one learns sporadically from the vast array of techniques and over time a unique knowledge develops, as if it was a greater picture built from puzzle pieces. This is similar to what is shown in the Learning How to Learn course and in Barbara Oakley‚Äôs book Mind for Numbers. I am learning how to set up an 11ty page and how to create a blog with 11ty from a starting project.

## Today I learnt

Today I learnt
What is final in Java [Java final Keyword](https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_keyword_final.asp). Wrote my first program in TypeScript. Final is like const in JavaScript

Is there a way to practice automated testing on codewars?

The idea for today is to do 8-6kyu katas in different languages I am learning and to keep exploring lightly. I do zone two cardio and listened to an episode of the Huberman podcast to ward against depression.

```
function wardAgainstDepression(person){
	person.listen(podcast)
	person.do(zoneTwoCardio)
	while(daytime) {
		!!happy && return person
	} return -1
}
```

I did a codechallenge which was fun, I had to implement a binarySearch function from a diagram in node, and then created a simple blog page in HTML and CSS. Fingers crossed I will get the job and will have a good income and will go üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

How can I write tests to simple programs?

At the end of the day I can share everything on facebook if it is creative.

I‚Äôm just looking at new terms. like fi. - if else fi
